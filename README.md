This is simple Javacript Pig game

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. 

As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))


### Game Rules

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins. See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))
